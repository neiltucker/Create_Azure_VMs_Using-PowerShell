# Create_Azure_VMs_Using-PowerShell
The scripts included will allow you to create virtual machines in Microsoft Azure using PowerShell scripts.  The scripts are used in the Microsoft Learning class 50331D to allow students to create a domain environment with a Windows 10 client and a domain controller running Windows Server 2016.  The scripts will create the Vms successfully, but without the classroom files, so some errors will be generated during execution.  The 50331AzureSetup.ps1 can create the VMs from a Windows computer.  50331AzureSetup_cs.ps1 can create the VMs from an Azure Cloud Shell.

Some knowledge of PowerShell is necessary to understand and run the scripts.  Parameters in the first section of the scripts must be modified to match your environment and Azure Subscription before executing them.
